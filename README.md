Firestorm is a REST API framework for .NET. The aim is to provide a neat and easy ways to write standardised APIs with more of the leg-work taken care of.

_Using [Stems](docs/stems/stems-intro.md) to describe your API_

```c#
public class CharactersStem : Stem<Character>
{
    [Get, Identifier]
    public static Expression Id => Expression(p => p.Id);

    [Get]
    public static Expression Name => Expression(p => p.FirstName + " " + p.LastName);
}
```

_Exposes [RESTful endpoints](docs/endpoints/navigation.md)_

```http
GET /characters/123

{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Eddard Stark"
}
```

## Features

1. **Clean.** Lets you write neat and concise code to describe your API and exposes lightweight, human-readable responses.

    - Natural [URL paths](docs/endpoints/navigation.md) e.g. `/characters/123/birthplace/name`.
    - To-the-point [querystrings](docs/endpoints/querying.md) e.g. `?status=alive&sort=name+asc&page=2`.
    - Uncluttered responses without extra metadata.

2. **Powerful.** Provides querying capabilities that combine database queries and application code.
    - Calculate an `age` field from `BirthDate` in your queries.
    - [Set](docs/stems/stems-basics.md#static-setter-methods) a `name` field by splitting into `FirstName` and `LastName` before saving.
    - Raise events on a message bus using [dependency injection](docs/stems/dependency-injection.md).

3. **Configurable.** Customise your conventions, response structure, verb strategies to suit your API needs. Integrate with your web host, ORM and IoC to fit nicely in your solution.

    - Include HTTP `Link` headers in [pagination](docs/endpoints/endpoint-config.md#response) responses.
    - Configure `PUT` or `PATCH` [strategy](docs/endpoints/endpoint-config.md#strategies) for partial updates.
    - Allow `camelCase` or `snake_case` [conventions](docs/endpoints/endpoint-config.md#namingconventionswitcher) in your responses.

## About

Firestorm is a bit of an experiment that grew into something I feel other developers could use. It was never a clearly defined project, but I decided to set some milestones and make it my first open-source project.

It's still in active development. There are a lot of features I want to add!
